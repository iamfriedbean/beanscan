Beanscan External Attack Surface Scan 

Traditional forms of security testing such as penetration testing are carried out in a very tight schedule usually in a pre-determined window often due to budget constraints. For this reason, scope of testing can be limited and does not scale widely to large digital footprint.  It is therefore crucial to have a tool that can discover and target large assets from day one – Beanscan does just that.​

Beanscan provides a discovery and audit workflow using carefully selected open source community tools unified together for wide scale external surface attack scanning. It can be used to aid in the initial phases of external attack surface management or first step to a more in-depth or targeted penetration type testing and red team engagement
